</div>

<div class="research">
<h6>PROTO PERSONA</h6>

 <p>
    We initiated our design process by creating a prototype persona, whom we named Josh. Josh, a 15-year-old student, is in the midst of crafting a school paper and simultaneously exploring the possibility of pursuing a career in cybersecurity. This proto persona serves as our guiding compass, embodying the diverse needs and aspirations of our user base, and informs our design decisions as we endeavor to create a user-friendly and engaging experience tailored to Josh's goals and challenges.
 </p>
 <h6>USER PATH</h6>
 <p>After defining a Proto Persona, we agreed that our users are gonna be students between elementary school and high school. This is some if the reason why we think theyâ€™ll be interested in visit the NSA website:
    <li>School research project: Students could be working on a school project related to national security or intelligence agencies and is visiting the NSA website to gather information</li>
    <br>
    <li>Personal interest: Students might have a personal interest in national security and intelligence activities and is visiting the NSA website to learn more about the agency's history, mission, and current activities</li>
    <br>
    <li>Career aspirations: Students might be considering a career in security or intelligence and is visiting the NSA website to learn more about the agency and their job opportunities</li>
    <br>
    <li>Internet browsing: Students could have stumbled upon the NSA website while browsing the internet and found the content interesting</li>

    <h6> HEURISTIC EVALUATION</h6>
    <p> A heuristic evaluation is a structured and methodical approach to assessing the usability and effectiveness of a digital interface or system. It involves the examination of a product by usability experts, who utilize a set of established usability principles or heuristics to identify potential issues and areas for improvement. This evaluation method plays a crucial role in ensuring that user interfaces meet high standards of usability, efficiency, and user satisfaction, ultimately leading to an enhanced user experience.</p>
    <h6>OBJECTIVE</h6>
    <p>Our objective with the heuristic evaluation was to pinpoint the primary issues within the website and devise innovative solutions to address them, ultimately aiming to enhance the user experience. By focusing on key problem areas, we sought to implement changes that would not only resolve existing issues but also contribute to an overall improved and more user-friendly website. This approach aligns with our mission to create a digital platform that is intuitive, efficient, and a pleasure to navigate.</p>
</div>
<div class="Results">
    <h6>RESULTS</h6>
    <p>Finding 1:
        Some of the topics in the navigation bar don't seem like they're priorities as far as the website is concerned.
        <li>Heuristic Broken: flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
        <li>Severity ranking: 3</li>
    </p>
    <p class="ex-1">Users may encounter confusion or frustration as they try to navigate through the site, struggling to find the most relevant and important information. This misalignment can lead to a less efficient and less satisfying user journey, potentially resulting in increased bounce rates and a negative overall perception of the website. Therefore, a well-prioritized and organized navigation bar is crucial to ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.</p>
    <p>Recommendation: Implement a card sorting to reorganize the navigation structure.</p>

    <p>Finding 2:
        The website exhibits inconsistency in its typographies, icons, and overall visual elements.    </p>
        <li>Heuristic Broken: Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
        <li>Severity ranking: 3</li>
    <p>Addressing inconsistencies in website visuals is essential for a polished and professional appearance, reinforcing brand identity, and ensuring a seamless user experience. It enhances recognition, trust, and overall effectiveness.</p>
    <p>Recommendation: Redesign the website's UI and develop a Style Tile to maintain visual consistency throughout the site.</p>

<div class="conclusion">
    <h6>CONCLUSION</h6>
    <p>
        The heuristic evaluation was instrumental in pinpointing critical issues, emphasizing the need for a well-prioritized navigation bar and the rectification of inconsistencies in typographies and visual elements. To address these, we recommended a card sorting process for navigation and a UI redesign with a Style Tile for visual consistency. Aligned with the overarching goal of creating a more intuitive and efficient platform, these solutions provide a roadmap for strategic enhancements. Notably, we advise revisiting and rewriting the information on each page to enhance clarity, contributing significantly to the NSA's ongoing effectiveness and global reputation.</p>
